# Predicting House Prices Using Image Detection
## GenAI Gurus: Kaitlyn Chen, Jonathan Wang, Ryan Guo

For our project, we will develop a model for multi-step time series prediction of the sale price of houses based on image detection. We are using a Kaggle dataset called [House Prices and Images - SoCal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal) to train our model. This dataset has ~15.5k images of the exterior of the house and a CSV that contains the columns: city, # beds, # baths, sqft, and price.
