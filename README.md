# Predicting House Prices Using Image Detection
## GenAI Gurus: Kaitlyn Chen, Jonathan Wang, Ryan Guo

For our project, we will develop a model for multi-step time series prediction of the sale price of houses based on image detection. We are using multiple datasets to train our model. two of our datasets have data on the prices of the houses, while two do not. The data encompasses over 20,000 images of home exteriors and interiors, and attribute data such as city, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage (in feet).
